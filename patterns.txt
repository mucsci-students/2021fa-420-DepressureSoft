## Design Patterns

1. Singleton - ModelHistory.java:41-49

2. Memento - ModelHistory.java:56-60

3. Iterator
  - Implemented to create a diagram model from an existing diagram model
  - File: DiagramModel.java
  - Line #: 49-55
  
4. Composite
  - The GUI uses a composite design pattern, as the JFrame is composed of JMenus, JLabels, JComboBoxes, and JPanels, all of which can be treated as individual objects with 
    possible children.
  - File: GUI.java

5. Adapter 
  - The GUI uses .toArray() to adapt an ArrayList of strings into a standard array.
  - File: GUI.java
  - Line #: 537
  
6. Bridge 
  - Relationship.java extends DiagramModel.java, such that Relationship.java handles all relationship types and their implementation, and DiagramModel.java handles class
    creation and only creates Relationship objects. New types of relationships could be added to Relationship.java without issue.
  - Files: Relationship.java, DiagramModel.java
  
7. Prototype
  - A copy constructor exists within UMLClass.java that allows a copy of an existing class to be made. This copy class is independent of its original.
  - File: UMLClass.java
  - Line #: 40-48

8. Facade
  - The user interacts with the CLI or GUI, both of which are facades providing a screen from the rest of the application implementation. 
  - Fles: UserInterface.java, GUI.java
